The original content is from the Center for Internet Security - Six Tabletop Exercises to Help Prepare Your Cybersecurity Team. 
What are Tabletop exercises? 
Tabletop exercises are meant to help organizations consider different risk scenarios and prepare for potential cyber threats. These are discussion-based exercises where team members meet in an informal setting to discuss roles during an emergency and our responses to a particular emergency situation. 
A facilitator guides participants through a discussion of one or more challenging scenarios that our organization may face. 
Why do Tabletops? 
Tabletops are an opportunity for organizational stakeholders to review and discuss the actions to take in specific emergency scenarios. Well-facilitated tabletops enable organizational stakeholders to gain insights before an emergency happens. This is an opportunity to test preparedness and response capabilities in an informal, low-stress environment. 
Tabletops are used to clarify roles and responsibilities and to identify additional mitigation and preparedness needs. 
Tabletop exercises are not tests or fire drills and are not meant to provide an evaluative result or to provide grounds to criticize any person or team. There is no "pass" or "fail" for a tabletop exercise.

Getting Started 
The objectives of a tabletop are to: 
• 
• 
• 
Provide a safe space for team members to openly discuss preparedness and response capabilities to the scenarios presented. 
Identify gaps or other weaknesses in our response capabilities and in our decision-making 
process 
Identify gaps or other weaknesses in our current practices that could be improved to reduce the likelihood and/or severity of a crisis 
Learning is the primary goal for a tabletop exercise. 
How to Run a Tabletop - Getting Started 
Each of the exercises featured in this white paper can be completed in as little as 15-20 minutes, making them a convenient tool for putting your team in a response mindset. In addition, each scenario will list the processes that are tested, threat actors that are identified, and the assets that are impacted. 
Implementing tabletops is a three phase process that can be broken down into Plan, Do and Improve.

How To Use 
Plan 
1. Clarify what objectives you are hoping to achieve from conducting a tabletop(s). Is the 
purpose of the tabletop to get a general understanding of organizational readiness and gaps, or is it to address a specific situation? 
2. Identify who will facilitate the tabletop and which tabletop scenarios you will be addressing. 3. Identify the stakeholders who will be involved in the tabletop. Your selection of 
stakeholders may vary depending on the scenario that you are addressing. 
Do 
1. Designate a Facilitator and identify members from business units to participate. We recommend 
the IDOARRT Meeting Design 'as a format for running the tabletop. Prior to the tabletop, outline each of these points: 
• 
Intention - What is the goal of doing the tabletop? 
• 
· 
Desired Outcome(s) - What specific results do you want from the tabletop? 
Agenda - What activities will be conducted during the tabletop? 
• 
Roles - Who is responsible for what during the tabletop? 
• 
· 
Rules - What ground rules will ensure a safe, productive tabletop? Time - How long will it take? 
2. Implement a selected tabletop exercise. 
• 
Read the scenario aloud to the group and ensure a common understanding. 
• 
Facilitate a conversation about how your organization would handle the scenario. 
Use the "questions to ask" section of the tabletops to facilitate discussion 
3. The Facilitator records the findings from the exercise(s). This includes gaps, lessons learned, and 
areas for investigation.

How To Use (con't) 
Improve 
• 
Address gaps by developing a short- and long-term Incident Response Plan. 
• 
• 
• 
Identify who will be responsible for addressing different aspects of the Incident Response Plan. 
Be as specific as possible about tasks and set due dates. 
Schedule a date for an accountability check-in. 
Schedule a date (annually, perhaps) to perform your next tabletop

The Deepfaked Special Guest 
(Disinformation Campaign) 
SCENARIO: Jackie, a new videography intern with Campaign Momentum Group (CMP), was thrilled to film a special event about dark money and politics featuring rising star Senate candidate, Lauren Tish, a few weeks before election day. The event ran late, so Jackie immediately uploaded the rough video to the CMP shared Dropbox account when she got home. The credentials for the Dropbox account are stored in her computer's Chrome browser. By the next morning, the event was all over the internet, along with the hashtag #TishFake. In the video Tish could be heard saying "Of course pharma helps pay for this. And since no one expects it, I can fake it." The video seemed off, but Tish's voice was clear. How would leadership explain this exploit for such a high stakes ally? Analysis quickly revealed that deep fake audio had been generated and inserted into the video. After reviewing with Dropbox, it was determined that someone had been logging into the shared Dropbox account from nearby Boston. More research revealed this was likely a former roommate of Jackie's who had grabbed the Dropbox password. Her former roommate was a 4Chan user and was seeking to boost his 4chan reputation by getting a hold of a candid Tish video so close to the election. The audio edits were surprisingly easy, and then once the roommate dropped his remake into the group, it was less than an hour before #TishFake got bot-propelled into a trending topic.

Discussion questions: 
· 
What is your response in this scenario? 
• 
Is there a password manager in place and is access to that controlled?

DDoS via bot 
SCENARIO: Early morning, November 3rd, 2020. Election day. George tried to login to CMS to update the blog and found the site was inaccessible. The site had been tested earlier, multiple times, and on multiple devices and everything had checked out. But now it was just shy of 1am and the site would not load and kept displaying the same message - Error 503. The server was down. After a few phone calls and repeated attempts, George woke Julie, the web developer. A few hours later she reported that it looked like they had been hit with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. There had been a spike in service right around midnight. The sheer volume of traffic could only be explained by a coordinated botnet flooding the site with traffic and data requests, bringing the server to a halt. The website host reported that they were working on the situation, but at present there was nothing they could do to bring the website online until the DDoS stopped.

Has the organization evaluated WAF (Web Application Firewalls) such as CloudFlare (Project Galileo) 
Is there any sort of Response Team at RepUs to ensure an organized, efficient response? 
Is there a process for escalating this incident - have all of the right internal and external contacts been contacted? 
Was there a monitoring system that could have identified this ahead of the site coming down? 
Do we have any sort of server backup plan? Is there a failover established, especially as a way to plan for crucial dates and events? 
• 
Had all website updates and patches been installed?

Free Wi-Fi Gets Quite Costly 
SCENARIO: Jason had been running late all day - he got to the airport for his pre-dawn flight late, the report that was due yesterday was still unfinished. It's easy to imagine his relief when he heard that the plane was unexpectedly delayed and Houston has free wifi. Even though Jason was wary of public wifi, he figured he could log on quickly, pull his document down for local editing and then get out. What he didn't realize was that the public wifi with the name "Free Airport Wi-Fi" was actually run by a hacker, who only needed a few seconds to have full access and grab Jason's network credentials. That's all the hacker needed to access the company's cloud drive and encrypt everything on it. Jason was 30,000 feet and finishing off the off-line version of the report by the time his colleagues down on terra firma were finding themselves locked out of their files with only a bitcoin ransomware message.

A Visit from the 
Anti-Science Doxxers 
- 
SCENARIO: You had really grown protective of Maxine, the researcher who had spearheaded the study that you hoped would put an end to the supposed "science" around the coal resurgence. You both knew that the push for coal had been nothing but well-funded political theater. You had been thinking how fortunate that Maxine wrapped up before the US Energy Summit. So, you were not at all prepared for the call that came in from her at 6am on the morning of the Summit. Her private information - home address, personal phone, the names of her children - was circulating on the web. She had started receiving calls during the night. You looked for yourself, comments about Maxine, about your organization, littered your organization's public Facebook page - in the hundreds, maybe even thousands. Your Twitter accounts showed tens of thousands of notifications. You learned that one caller threatened to find Maxine's youngest child at school, another said he was right outside waiting for her. She called the police who arrived 20 minutes later to a dead animal placed on the front door mat along with several lumps of coal. The police were there when she called you. She was calling to let you know so that you could take care of things for the organization.

The Compromised Sendee 
SCENARIO: You woke up from your sleep in a state. You were pretty sure that the special reporter knew to keep her identity and whereabouts under cover, at least until after the Copenhagen event. But the email you got from her a few hours ago just didn't seem right. You checked. It was from the right account, the one she used only for this project, and only you and a few others even knew about it. It just didn't sound like her. You knew you should have called but it was late, so you sent the latest version of the research without calling first as you normally might have, especially given that the email just didn't quite sound like her. You checked your email again. Nothing back from her, but it had gone out and the report with all of the damning information was in there. There it was in "sent." You try calling and she doesn't pick up.

Your passport and necessary papers were in order, everything seemed fine until your one-word answer to the question to the armed guard about your profession, "Journalist." You were told to sit down and hand over your electronic devices. You pulled your phone from a pocket immediately, with a smile, in the hopes that the guard wouldn't ask you to open your bags and handover your laptop. A few minutes later, he was back, he couldn't unlock the phone "give me your password" and then "You got a computer?"

Connecting the OSINT Dots 
SCENARIO: Sanjay and Gerald were relieved. The fruits of their labor would finally culminate in a indisputable report of the facts - "Who is Funding Oil Politics in Indonesia?". On the verge of release, it was not too soon to start laying groundwork, so Gerald naturally asked Global Energy Fact Finders (GEFF) to start promoting the report on its Twitter feed. With barely a mention of its author, Sanjay's energy activist group posted a few of the more telling images - a set of diagrams clearly delineating sources of dark-money influence. What neither Gerald nor Sanjay were aware of was that Indonesian powers-that- be had been following both of them closely through open source intelligence service. The near simultaneous social media posts would be key in tying the GEFF report with Sanjay's group, considered too radical by many professional circles. Exposing this connection would surely hurt both the reputation of the report and its sponsoring organization. It was hoped that the threat of a ransom demand and exposure would put an end to the report's release to the public. This connection also provided the Indonesian government with motivation to jail Sanjay on some minor infraction, and put an end to his relentless sniffing around.

The Open Vault 
SCENARIO: One of your company's newer web developers, Jake, calls his direct manager, Sara, to report that he got an email about a login to his 1Password account from Poznan, Poland a couple weeks ago. He acknowledges that he should have reported it when it first happened but he didn't think it was anything serious. But Jake got another notification of a login the previous night from Sydney, Australia. Sara learns that Jake's 1Password credentials were similar to a password he used frequently and that he had not set up 2FA for his 1Password account. Jake had been providing maintenance for several high profile client projects -- one was a website for a political advocacy organization campaigning on a very contentious ballot measure on immigration. The organization's website is used to gather supporter and volunteer data. No clients have reported anything suspicious yet.

The Holiday Buffalo Jump 
(specific to IT Service Providers) 
SCENARIO: It's Sunday morning, November 29th, 2020. Everyone except a few Tier 1 helpdesk personnel is enjoying the last day of the Thanksgiving holiday. At around 11AM, senior engineers on call start seeing their phones light up. Some customers have called in saying they can't access their workstations. The Tier 1 helpdesk can't get into the PSA or the RMM systems. As the hours pass, more customers call in saying both servers and workstations are inaccessible. By 3:00 PM, you have determined that attackers have compromised both your PSA and your RMM and have locked you out of both systems. Many, possibly all workstations and servers in the RMM environment are locked with ransomware, but you can't tell how many because you can't access the RMM yet. At 4:30 PM, the attackers get in touch. The attackers provide proof that they have exfiltrated data from the compromised environments and threaten to publish to the dark web if the ransom isn't paid. The attackers are asking for $600,000 to unlock everything and delete the exfiltrated data.

Exercise 19 
The Third-Party Leak 
SCENARIO: You get the following email from your CRM vendor, Zombo. 
In June of 2020, Zombo discovered and stopped an attack. 
Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out, the cybercriminal exfiltrated a subset of data from our environment. The cybercriminal did not access credit card information, bank account information, or social security numbers. Because protecting our customers' data was our top priority, we paid the cybercriminal's demand with confirmation that the copy they removed had been destroyed. 
What This Means for Your Organization Specifically 
A copy of your Zombo CRM data was part of this incident. The cybercriminal did not gain access to credit card numbers, bank account information, usernames, passwords, or social security numbers stored in your database because they were encrypted. None of your data was lost or corrupted as a result of this incident. 
What is your response? 
Discussion questions: 
• 
What is your first response upon getting this email? 
• 
Do you have an incident response plan that can be put into action for this situation? 
• 
• 
• 
• 
How can you determine what information was part of this breach? How can you determine which clients were affected? 
Do you know what your legal notification requirements are for your affected customers? 
Do 
you have cyber liability insurance for this type of incident? Do you know what support your insurer can provide? Legal? Incident Response? PR? 
What, if anything, do you tell your clients? How/when do you notify them? Do you have 
communication templates in place for this type of situation? 
Given the information breached, how can you mitigate future risk of this information being used by attackers against you and/or your clients?

The Deep State Deep Fake 
SCENARIO: Dena Digital is a digital strategy consultancy that specializes in helping progressive organizations with campaigns, such as fundraising, but also contentious ballot measures across the United States. Dena Marks, the CEO of Dena Digital, is a charismatic leader who is frequently interviewed on podcasts and radio programs. Dena was recently interviewed harshly criticizing a congresswoman who is an outspoken follower of the deep state conspiracy group K-ANON. Dena is travelling internationally and, earlier in the week, had tweeted about how excited she was to be attending an upcoming digital conference in Sweden. Sam, a senior developer at Dena's Digital, notices a missed call and voicemail from Dena's mobile number when he turns on his phone in the morning. Sam listens to the voicemail from Dena, 
"Sam, this is Dena. I got locked out of my Gmail account and can't get to my email or Google Drive. By the time you get this voicemail I'll be in conference sessions, so you won't be able to reach me. Can you please email my Google account password to my personal email as soon as you get this? My personal email is dena.digital@protonmail.com. Please do this as soon as you get this message. Thanks a ton!" 
Sam immediately complies with the request, but when he doesn't hear back from Dena after several hours, he decides to give her a call. Sam gets her voicemail and leaves a message asking her to confirm that she got the passwords. A few hours later, Sam tries to login to the agency's Google Ads account, but gets a message that he does not have access to the Google Ads account. As he is investigating this, he gets a phone call from a frantic sounding Dena saying she never left such a voicemail and wasn't locked out of her account, but that now she is locked out of her accounts. 
What is your response? 
Discussion questions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Did you provide security awareness training to all personnel? Within the past year? Did this training cover social engineering? Did this training cover new and emerging threats such as deep fake audio? 
Do you have a policy governing acceptable information sharing on social media? 
Was 2FA enforced for all agency Google accounts? Was SMS discouraged or disabled as a 2FA option? 
Do you have an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that identifies a response team and a checklist of actions with contact information for needed resources? 
What policies exist about acceptable methods of sharing passwords and other restricted information? 
Does your cyber liability insurer provide services to help with a response? Do you have their claim information readily accessible?
